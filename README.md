# leetCodeSolutions

this is a repo meant to just publically post and back up my leet code answers.
<br/>
there is no promise for quality or anything specific like that, just for fun and the learning experiance
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
this is partly done by the extention: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/leetcode-torture/
<br/>
mainly to motivate me to do more learning lol
<br/>
all files should be sorted via file extension.
<br/>
at the time of writing, these file extensions include:

- cpp (c++)
- go (go lang)
- js (javascript)
- rs (rust)
- sql (structured query language)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the reason for these languages is:
  <br/>
  (note the below is my preferences/opinions on said languages)
- cpp is a great language which is still used, though has some rather rough edges that are rather toothy
- go is a great language that i consider to be "python++", a language with the ease of python, but with much more preformance and a lot less annoying quirks
- js i sa nice scripting language. it's toothy and hard to use for anything longterm/critical; but is great for quick simple things and obviously anything web related
- rs a modern low level language which is a bit rough around the edges. has some issues but overall is much safer and more predictable then cpp
- sql the defacto db standard, maybe not the best but rather solid
