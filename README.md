this is a repo meant to just publically post and back up my leet code answers.
<br/>
there is no promise for quality or anything specific like that, just for fun and the learning experiance
<br/>

<br/>
this is partly done by the extention: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/leetcode-torture/
<br/>
mainly to motivate me to do more learning lol
<br/>

- go    (go lang)
- js    (javascript)
- rs    (rust)
- sql   (structured query language)
