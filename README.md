# leetCodeSolutions

this is a repo meant to just publically post and back up my leet code answers.

there is no promise for quality or anything specific like that, just for fun and the learning experiance
<br/>

this is partly done by the extention: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/leetcode-torture/
