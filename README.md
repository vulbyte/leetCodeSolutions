# leetCodeSolutions

this is a repo meant to just publically post and back up my leet code answers.

<br/>

there is no promise for quality or anything specific like that, just for fun and the learning experiance

<hr/>

this is partly done by the extention: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/leetcode-torture/

<br/>

mainly to motivate me to do more learning lol

<br/>

all files should be sorted via file extension.

<br/>

at the time of writing, these file extensions include:

- cpp (c++)
- cs (c#)
- go (go lang)
- js (javascript)
- rs (rust)
- sql (structured query language)

<hr/>

the reason for each one of these languages is:

#### note the below is my preferences/opinions on said languages

### - C++:

is a great language which is still used, though has some rather rough edges that are rather toothy

### - C#:

for people who think windows is the best os, or unity

### - Go:

is a great language that i consider to be "python++", a language with the ease of python, but with much more preformance and a lot less annoying quirks

### - JS:

is a nice scripting language. it's toothy and hard to use for anything longterm/critical; but is great for quick simple things and obviously anything web related

### - Rust:

a modern low level language which is a bit rough around the edges. has some issues but overall is much safer and more predictable then cpp.

### - SQL:

the defacto db standard, maybe not the best but rather solid

<hr/>

### languages that leetcode supports that i haven't touched yet:

and some reasoning for why for fun

#### - Python <br/>

i'm sure it's great, but as far as i'm aware outside working on legacy systems i'm not really interested in python as the performance isn't great, and the only benefit i know of it is it's "easy to write" outside of the libs.

#### - Python3 <br/>

<br/>
above + <br/>
i'm sure i'll touch it at some point when i want to brush up before using a big python lib

#### - Java

i don't want to mod minecraft or work in legacy codebases

#### - C

i technically already do because i do cpp, which is a super-set of c but bluhbluhbluh you get the idea

#### - TS

i use typescript for projects, but if it's for leetcode i don't really need a linter to help me handle functions. just pretend each var and fn has a ":any" and you have typescript

<br/>

#### - PHP

php is fun, though if i'm building a website i would prefer js/react as i prefer writing it. i've learned php before and know the basics, seems fun, but for me feels like it competes with js and i would prefer to stick to the path moreso tread with web stuff

#### - Swift

5/13<br/>
seems kewl, sounds fun, but i'm not making programs for apple devices, so for now i'd rather probably learn a more funcitonal lang like oCaml over swift rn

#### - Kotlin

i (thank god) don't need to work in legacy java systems, and don't see any immediate uses for it in my life at the moment so. if i ever had a use for it i would totally reach for it, but i don't really need it so i don't want to get into weeds i don't need too

#### - Dart

i've never heard anyone talk about any amazing reason to use this, so i won't lol

#### - Ruby

sounds like a java esc lang from what i heard at a glance, but i don't really know of a reason to learn it outside rails so i don't really have any interest

#### - Scala

same thing as kotlin. seems neat but eh

<br/>

#### - Racket

never heard of it before seeing it in leetcode. i have no reason that i can think of to learn this

#### - Erlang

from what i heard is an amazing lang for large scaling, i would prefer to learn elixir first, but after i did that i would love to swing back to erlang to get a better understanding of the "top down"

#### - Elixir

sounds great, probably my next "free choice" language to learn. Heard basically nothing but good things
